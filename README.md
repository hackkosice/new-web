[![Hack Kosice](https://circleci.com/gh/hackkosice/new-web.svg?style=shield)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hackkosice)

New website for Hack Kosice using Hugo.


## Making changes

### Editing live

When you want to make changes to the live website, you can either use Git (for developers mostly), or edit the contents directly in GitHub. All changes on the `master` branch will be automatically tested for correctness, built and deployed to [dev.hackkosice.com/master](https://dev.hackkosice.com/master), or substitute master with any branch name. The update should take at most couple of seconds. You can check when the website was last built in the footer.

Once you merge the branch back to `master`, a full build (taking 2-3 minutes) will take place and upload the website to Firebase, making it accessible at [hackkosice.com](https://hackkosice.com).

### Local installation

If you prefer developing locally (you can preview any changes immediately and without having to commit), follow these steps:

1.  [Install **Hugo extended**](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.  `git clone git@github.com:hackkosice/new-web && cd new-web`
3.  `npm install`
4.  `hugo server -DF` to start a local server (`-DF` is to include drafts and posts dated in the future) or just `hugo -DF` to build the website (to the `public` directory)

If you are developing locally, running `hugo server` will rebuild on any file changes, reflecting updates automatically and immediately.

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/hackkosice/new-web/issues) shows all things that still *need to be done*. Please, take any issue and just do it üôÇ


## Getting Started

### Structure

- `assets` - images and other assets that need pre-processing (usually, all images are loaded from this folder, so that they can be resized, compressed, and cut as needed)
- `config.yml` - global configuration (website title, menu, metadata, other options)
- `content` - contains all the content: pages, blog posts, portfolio
- `static` - images and other static assets that are kept without any modification (unlike `assets`)
- `themes/orbitor-hugo` - the theme, defining how `content` is viewed
    - `assets` - JS and CSS code
    - `layouts` - HTML templates, HTML code and shortcodes
    
### Page metadata

Each page has a block delimited by `---`, containing information such as the page's title, date, appearance in the menu, whether it should be published, and more. The page metadata, as well as all other configuration blocks, are written in [YAML](https://github.com/Animosity/CraftIRC/wiki/Complete-idiot's-introduction-to-yaml). For example:

```yaml
---
title: Page example
date: 2020-07-06T11:46:13+00:00
description: This will be shown in google search and other places as a description.
bgImage: "images/bg/background.jpg"
menu: main
---

...website content goes here!
```

If you add `draft: true` to the metadata, the given page will not be published in production.

### Create a simple page

Content of each page, after the metadata block, is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

1.  Create a new file in the `content` directory, named `something.md` (where `/something` is be the path how you access the page)
2.  Copy the content from [bare-markdown.md](https://github.com/hackkosice/new-web/blob/master/content/other/bare-markdown.md), and edit it as needed. The file contains page metadata (delimited by `---`), then page contents.

### Create a rich page

A more advanced page can be composed of sections of various types. The `basic` type is just what you saw above - a simple page is just one `basic` section.
 
- A rich page is distinguished by specifying `use_sections: true` in the page metadata. See [preview-all-sections.md](https://github.com/hackkosice/new-web/blob/master/content/other/preview-all-sections.md) for an example.
- In Markdown, you create a section by surrounding the content with `{{< section type="banner" config="banner1" >}}` and `{{< /section >}}`, where `type` defines the type of the row, and `config` specifies which values from the page metadata should be used to populate the section with data. See the example file.

The following **page types** are supported:

- `basic`
- `banner`
- `bannerFeature`
- `feature`
- `cta`
- `project`
- `counter`
- `clients`
- `testimonial`
- `bigcounter`
- `promovideo`
- `team`
- `pricing`
- `services`
- `casestudy`
- `solutions`
- `smallcta`
- `contact`
- `map`
- `branch`

### Add a page to the menu

Use the following code in the page's metadata to add the page to the `main` menu:

```yaml
menu: main
```

or customise the menu entry with more options

```yaml
menu:
  main:
    identifier: blog_post_3
    name: Blog post 3
    parent: Blog
    weight: 20
```

### Include an image

Upload the image to the `assets` folder (in a reasonable subdirectory) and use the following shortcode in markdown files (see [bare-markdown.md](https://github.com/hackkosice/new-web/blob/master/content/other/bare-markdown.md) for usage):

```markdown
{{< image asset="images/lectures/hacker.jpg" format="400x267 q60 jpg" alt="Hacker" >}}
```

with the following parameters:

- `asset` is a path to the image within the `assets` folder
- `format` contains information about how the image should be compressed:
    - size (width x height)
    - quality (`q100` means 100% quality), where `q60` is a good value to choose as you still can't see a difference by eye (or `q80` if you really need a high-quality image)
    - format - you can just use `jpg` in most cases
- `alt` - alternate text (description of the image), shown if the image cannot be displayed (i.e. the user is blind and has a screen reader, or when loading of images is disabled)

### Include another file

If you want the same part/section/text to be included in multiple pages:

- create a file with the *shared* content in the `assets` folder (for example: [included-file.md](https://github.com/hackkosice/new-web/blob/master/assets/sample/included-file.md))
- use the following shortcode in all pages where you want to include the content, where `file` is the relative location of the file within the `assets` folder:
    
    ```markdown
    {{< include file="sample/included-file.md" >}}
    ```

### Make more URLs point to the same content

Add this to a page's metadata to make it available by redirecting to it from multiple URL addresses under hackkosice.com.

```yaml
aliases:
  - /events/alternative-link
```

### External redirects

If you want an URL to cause a redirect outside of hackkosice.com, modify `firebase.json`, find the `"redirects":` section, and add a rule in the following form.

```json
    "redirects": [
      ...
      {
        "source": "/url",
        "destination": "https://custom.domain.com/page",
        "type": 302
      }
    ],
```

*Note 1: This only works on Firebase, i.e. you will have to wait for the [full build](#editing-live) of [hackkosice.com](https://hackkosice.com), and the redirects won't work under [dev.hackkosice.com](https://dev.hackkosice.com), so you can't test it inside a custom branch.*

*Note 2: If you have loaded the page (presumably getting a "Page Not Found" error), you may need to force reload (or delete cache) in your browser after making this change to view the effect.

### Adding a team member

1.  Add a profile picture to the [assets/images/team](assets/images/team) directory. It's good to name the image using the person's `id` (which is equal to the username in the email address, i.e. the email `mtarca@hackkosice.com` corresponds to the id `mtarca`)
2.  Add the person to the list of all people in [data/people.yml](data/people.yml), following this form:
    
    ```yaml
      - id: juraj
        name: Juraj Miƒçko
        image: images/team/juraj.jpg
        designation: Founder, Hacker Service
        social:
          - icon: ti-email
            link: 'mailto:juraj@hackkosice.com'
          - icon: ti-facebook
            link: https://www.facebook.com/micko.juraj
          - icon: ti-linkedin
            link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/juraj-micko
    ```
    
3.  Now you can refer to the person by their `id` and add them to arbitrary list of people on the website. For example, modify [content/about.md](content/about.md) to add the person to the [About us](https://hackkosice.com/about/) page. (Note: you can override any of the properties each time you refer to the person)

    ```yaml
    teamMember:
      ...
      - id: juraj
        designation: Hacker Service (temporary)
    ```


## Development advice

- When adding script/style/font files, put it in the `assets` folder and use at least [Hugo's fingerprint](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/fingerprint/) functionality to include the file's hash in its file name. This is important because **Firebase is set up to allow caching of all script/style/font files for up to 1 year**, therefore including a file without its fingerprint in the file name will result in the file almost never being updated on the client side.
