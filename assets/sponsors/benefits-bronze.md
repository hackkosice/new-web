## Logo on the website and banner

Your companyâ€™s logo will be displayed on our website before, during and some time after the hackathon. Your logo will also be showcased on a banner in the venue during the hackathon. Your company may also be presented in other selected promotional materials (videos, leaflets, etc.)

## Send branded items

All hackers will receive a welcome package upon registration at the venue. This will include:

- various Hack Kosice items (stickers, T-Shirts etc.)
- branded items from our sponsors (pens, stickers, anti stress balls, power banks etc.)

You are expected to provide merchandise that you want us to distribute to hackers. You should deliver these items to the organising team at least two days before the event.

## CVs of participants

Since the capacity of the venue is limited and we are expecting much more applications than positions available, we require our participants to submit their resumes, which will be used to review their applications. The resume information of participants will be available to you on 12.9.2020  Saturday, 7 days after the event.
