## Send branded items

All hackers will receive a welcome package upon registration at the venue. This will include:

You are expected to provide merchandise that you want us to distribute to hackers. You should deliver these items to the organising team at least two days before the event.

## CVs of participants

Since the capacity of the venue is limited, and we are expecting much more applications than positions available, we require our participants to submit their resumes, which will be used to review their applications. The resume information of participants will be available to you on 29.8.2020 Saturday, 7 days before the event.

- We will ask you to send your presentations a week prior the event, as part of an action list.
- Contact us if you need any other presentation aids that are unavailable to you

### Send hardware and APIs

If your company has any hardware or APIs, we encourage you to provide them to hackers so they can use them for free in their projects during the hackathon. If you can combine a cool hardware/API with helpful mentors that can give hackers some advice on using those products, this can be highly beneficial. Not only the hackers will produce something amazing that may catch your eye, but your company might as well find a few people with the exact skill set you are looking for.

### Have a workshop

Give a technical presentation along with a practical demonstration in around 60 mins. The purpose of this is to expand the hackers’ horizons, so it could be programming related or anything else that might be interesting for hackers. Live coding workshops are especially popular.

It can be:

- Introducing some part of your product
- Topics your company works with or uses a lot
- Technology that hackers might use in their own hackathon project (CockroachDB, Docker, Building apps for Slack)
- Tips on how to effectively work for 24 hours on a hackathon
- How to market your product to succeed in the IT business

Please contact us if you are interested in running a workshop or if you have an idea for a great workshop topic. We strongly recommend you to come up with topic ideas. The organizing team will provide further guidance with the organization of workshops.

### Challenge and prize

You can organise your very own Hack Kosice challenge named after your company with the focus of the prize also decided by jury consisting from your company’s mentors and other representatives (e.g. Newcomer award by Your Company, Machine Learning challenge by Your Company, etc.)

- All sponsors are expected to provide valuable (not neccesarily cash) prizes for the winners of the category they own (Platinum, Gold), mentor or recruit from. Good examples of such prizes are various consumer electronics articles such as keyboards, mouses.
- We recommend to give prizes roughly equal to 20% of the sponsorship contribution.
- The organising team will invite various independent IT personalities to the hackathon as mentors or speakers. You are welcome to assign roles to these independent mentors as associate judges of your category.
- More guidance will be provided by the organizing team on individual basis.
