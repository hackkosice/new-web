It can be:

Please contact us if you are interested in running a workshop or if you have an idea for a great workshop topic. We strongly recommend you to come up with topic ideas. The organizing team will provide further guidance with the organization of workshops.

You can organise your very own Hack Kosice challenge named after your company with the focus of the prize also decided by jury consisting from your company’s mentors and other representatives (e.g. Newcomer award by Your Company, Machine Learning challenge by Your Company, etc.)

- All sponsors are expected to provide valuable (not neccesarily cash) prizes for the winners of the category they own (Platinum, Gold), mentor or recruit from. Good examples of such prizes are various consumer electronics articles such as keyboards, mouses.
- We recommend to give prizes roughly equal to 20% of the sponsorship contribution.
- The organising team will invite various independent IT personalities to the hackathon as mentors or speakers. You are welcome to assign roles to these independent mentors as associate judges of your category.
