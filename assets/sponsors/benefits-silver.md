## Logo on the website and banner

Your company’s logo will be displayed on our website before, during and some time after the hackathon. Your logo will also be showcased on a banner in the venue during the hackathon. Your company may also be presented in other selected promotional materials (videos, leaflets, etc.)

## Send branded items

All hackers will receive a welcome package upon registration at the venue. This will include:

- various Hack Kosice items (stickers, T-Shirts etc.)
- branded items from our sponsors (pens, stickers, anti stress balls, power banks etc.)

You are expected to provide merchandise that you want us to distribute to hackers. You should deliver these items to the organising team at least two days before the event.

## CVs of participants

Since the capacity of the venue is limited, and we are expecting much more applications than positions available, we require our participants to submit their resumes, which will be used to review their applications. The resume information of participants will be available to you on 29.8.2020 Saturday, 7 days before the event.

### Send Mentors & Send Recruiters

We offer you the opportunity to send your employees and representatives to the event. In general, there are 2 kinds of representatives, mentors and recruiters. The following list outlines their roles:

**Mentors (max. 2):**

- Could be senior programmers, experts in full-stack development
- Expected to help with technical parts of the hackathon projects
- Walk around the team tables looking for teams needing advice
- Make sure that teams are on the right path to create a presentable product
- Give your company an opportunity to showcase the expertise of their employees
- Have the chance to assess the skill set of hackers to provide valuable information in the recruitment process

**Recruiters (max. 1):**

### Your stand at the event

A separate dedicated space for your company to set up any promotional materials:

- Each stand will be provided with a table and chairs by our organising team
- You are welcome to bring any roll-up banners, leaflets, freebies or other materials to make your stand attractive to hackers
- The organising team has reserved right to choose the stand, its location and size, which will be assigned to your company. The organising team will make best efforts to match the stand with your company’s interests.
- Details regarding the stands such as the size of the stand, max. number of roll-up banners etc. will be announced in further updates.

### Send hardware and APIs

If your company has any hardware or APIs, we encourage you to provide them to hackers so they can use them for free in their projects during the hackathon. If you can combine a cool hardware/API with helpful mentors that can give hackers some advice on using those products, this can be highly beneficial. Not only the hackers will produce something amazing that may catch your eye, but your company might as well find a few people with the exact skill set you are looking for.
