## Who we are

We are a group of young and active Slovak students, highly passionate about inventing and exploring new ideas, innovating and improving current ones, and by doing this trying to better and enrich the world around us.

**Our mission is to educate and empower students in the field of IT and Tech, but also everyone who believes in changing the world positively through innovation.**

Hack Kosice has a long-term support from [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/), the world-wide official hackathon league.

{{< section type="feature" config="what_we_do" >}}
We bring the great experience of international hackathons closer to our home, Slovakia, and as a result, create something extraordinary.

We believe that by opening our country to the world and promoting the international spirit of this event to Slovak students, we effectively enrich both sides and help create a friendly atmosphere stimulating development & innovation.

We also hope to contribute and to change Slovakia to become a hub of innovation and development of the 21st century.

{{< section type="sideimg" config="why_kosice" >}}
The â€˜capital of the Eastâ€™ is currently one of the most active and vivid centres of technological progress in the region of Central and East Europe.

With a high concentration of computer science students from local universities and a number of important tech-related companies, the city opens up to a number of possibilities for the effective organisation of a high-quality hackathon.

{{< section type="sideimg" config="how_it_started" class="bg-white" >}}
It all started as a crazy idea of a few crazy guys from KoÅ¡ice, after they began university studies in the UK. The Hack Kosice project was officially born on 4 Apr 2018 at a fishing trip ðŸ™‚

So, why *a hackathon* in *Kosice*?

- We always aspired to give something back to our 'home' community - before, we gave talks at some high schools about international opportunities and helped younger students with their applications to study abroad
- We are students of mainly Computer Science, but also Engineering, Design, Business and Social Sciences.
- We attended a few hackathons and were inspired by everyone's passion. Hackathons changed our lives and we want to continue with positively changing lives of others.
- [MLH](https://mlh.io/) was a perfect way to bring something new, yet well-tested, popular in the western parts of the world, to KoÅ¡ice
- KoÅ¡ice is our home city and Slovakia is our motherland, and there weren't any great hackathons there

Hence, [Hack Kosice]({{< static "/" >}}) was born. **Welcome to the family!**
