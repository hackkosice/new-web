*“I have attended more than 50 hackathons worldwide and Hack Kosice is among the best events I have been to. Despite it being the first edition of Hack Kosice, the event felt really well put together and the production quality was absolutely top notch.”* **Aaron - Major League Hacking**

*“We are really happy that we could participate with all of you. It was definitely a great weekend with a lot of positive energy. As the first-timers in organization, it was done on very high level - you are professionals :-) Many thanks to all of you, honestly best event we took part on for a long time :-)”* **Mediworks - software solutions a.s.**
