{{< section class="bg-light" >}}
This year was slightly different than the previous year. Due to the coronavirus pandemic we decided to [postpone]({{< ref `/hackathon/corona-official-reschedule` >}}) the hackathon from March to September and after profound consideration chose to host the hackathon [online]({{< ref `/hackathon/going-online` >}}). We hosted a non-stop **32-hour live stream** on Youtube which included the opening ceremony, workshops by our sponsors, fun with Hack Kosice activities such as evening poetry, Kosice tour or cooking a midnight pizza. Additionally, we used [Swapcard](https://www.swapcard.com/virtual-events/) to connect hackers with mentors, recruiters and organisers, and bring everyone the best possible experience. The [best projects](#winners) were awarded prizes.

Watch the keynote & opening ceremony by Katka and Pavol below. More videos from the stream coming soon. Hope to see you at Hack Kosice 2021!
