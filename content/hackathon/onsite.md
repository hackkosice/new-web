# Accommodation
Due to security measures caused by the global pandemic, this year **there will be no sleeping facilities** set up inside the venue. We know this is particarly inconvenient for those of you
who don't live in Kosice and therefore we have come up with a number of alternatives:
* Book a room in [kosicehostel.sk](http://www.kosicehostel.sk/?lang=en) - very close to the venue, but limited capacity; let us know if you need any help with reservations
