  content: A hackathon is a creative and social 24-hour event where students come together in small teams to share ideas and build something new and exciting, alongside a whole bunch of like-minded people. You learn immensely with the help of mentors, interact with companies and have fun! Hackathons are very beginner friendly and open to students passionate about innovations, technology, engineering, entrepreneurship, design, or more!

# Online + Hubs

Our team has worked tirelessly to come up with ways to provide a safe hacking environment, while maintaining high levels of engagement for all. Due to Covid-19, we unfortunately had to cancel our amazing venue Kunsthalle, Kosice — so **do not travel** to the venue in Kosice (updated as of 20 August).

However, to keep the hype you are expecting, you can **participate from a Hub!**
