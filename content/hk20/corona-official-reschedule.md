# Official statement regarding Coronavirus

*Due to Covid-19, Hack Kosice 2020 is rescheduled to 5–6 September 2020.*

**Košice, 12 March 2020**

In the light of the current situation regarding COVID-19, we must inform that, in order to help resolve the situation and for the safety of all involved parties, the Hack Kosice organising team was forced to decide to postpone the “Hack Kosice” hackathon with the originally planned date of 28–29. March 2020.

We treated the situation seriously from the beginning, and our team was prepared to protect participating stakeholders and public security. We have consulted with the relevant authorities (Public Health Authority, Ministry of Health) on the detailed safety precautions, as well as followed the recommendations of the WHO and the European Parliament. Nevertheless, the situation deteriorated and our decision was enforced by instructions and recommendations of the public authorities of Slovakia, the City of Košice, the Košice Self-Governing Region and other authorities. The organizing team of Hack Kosice therefore confirms that Hack Kosice is rescheduled to 5–6 September 2020.

Our team is now working intensively on the steps needed to reschedule the event. We regret the situation, but we believe that the necessary steps to reschedule Hack Kosice will not affect the quality of the hackathon, and moreover, the new date will allow the event to take place:

- in an international atmosphere,
- involving all confirmed hackers and partners,
- without the risk of significant tradeoffs.

At the time of writing, Hack Kosice has already secured the venue and the support of Major League Hacking, Pavol Jozef Šafárik University and a majority of our partners on the new proposed date. We look forward to continuing the vision of Hack Kosice with your support too.

On behalf of the Hack Kosice organising team,
