# Hack Kosice: Official statement regarding the organisation of HK20

**Košice, 20th August 2020**

In the light of the worsening conditions connected to the current pandemic, and in order to protect first and foremost the safety of every participant of Hack Kosice 2020, the Hack Kosice organising team has opted for changing the way in which the event is going to be held, and thus to **cancel all on-site participation** in the premises provided by the organiser.

This decision has been a natural outcome of long discussions within the team, but also with relevant health authorities such as:  

- local medical care centres and other health professionals
- ÚVZSR and RÚVZKE
- members of the Crises Management Team of Ministry of Interior Affairs

It is in our best interest to **ensure the safety of every participant** and enable them a full experience of HK20. Hence, Hack Kosice team is currently developing a plan which would enable each and every hacker to experience something truly extraordinary. 

As a result, we can present you **Hack Kosice 2020**, a *sui generis* hackathon, which will:

- be accessible for hackers from all around the world through its online platform
- enable participants to connect and meet within casual hubs anywhere in the world, and thus bring the true spirit of HK to every city
- bring the first-hand feeling of hackathon through 24/7 professional stream filled with Speeches, Workshops, Fun Activities, Live HK Cam, and many more
- enable you to network with Sponsors and other Hackers very easily
- bring you fantastic challenges from our Sponsors which would require your innovativeness and bright thinking
- deliver you things such as swag or food vouchers to your doors to truly mirror the spirit of on-site hackathon

The Hack Kosice 2020 has come through rough times, but the future awaits only those who can adapt and change. And so we did. Just try. 

Hack Kosice 2020 - a real hackathon.  

Best, 

Andrea Komova<br>
Project Lead | Hack Kosice
