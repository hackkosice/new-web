Hack Kosice 2020 was slightly different than the previous year. Due to the coronavirus pandemic we decided to postpone the hackathon from March to September and after profound consideration chose to host the hackathon online. We hosted 32 hours non-stop Youtube livestream which included opening ceremony, workshops by our sponsors, fun with Hack Kosice activities such as Evening poetry, Kosice tour or Midnight Pizza. Additionally, we used swapcards platform to connect hackers with mentors and recruiters. By doing so we managed to deliver the participants the best experience. Thank you and see you at Hack Kosice 2021!
