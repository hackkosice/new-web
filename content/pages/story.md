# Hack Kosice was born

A hackathon in Kosice, Slovakia, organised by Slovak students, supported by Major League Hacking.

It all started as a crazy idea of a few crazy guys from Gymnazium Postova in Kosice, after they started our studies in the UK. The Hack Kosice project was officially born on 4 Apr 2018 at a fishing trip :)

So, why *a hackathon* in *Kosice*?

- We always aspired to give something back to our 'home' community - before, we gave talks at some high schools about international opportunities and helped younger students with their applications to study abroad
- We study Computer Science
- We attended a few hackathons and were inspired by everyone's passion. Hackathons changed our lives.
- MLH was a perfect way to bring something new, yet well-tested, popular in the western parts of the world, to Kosice
- There was nothing like a good hackathon in Kosice.

Hence, [Hack Kosice](https://hackkosice.com) was born. **Welcome in the family!**
