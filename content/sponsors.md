### Action lists

In order to make this hackathon happen we will need you to send us pieces of information or take some actions. From time to time we will send you a list of actions to be taken by you and we ask you to act upon those.

### Action list 1 - ASAP

Below are some items we expect from you within one week of us sending the contract draft

1. Please send us your company’s logo, preferably in a vector format (will be used by the marketing team)
2. Send us your company’s name you want to use and a short description (5-6 sentences, will be used by the marketing team)
3. Send us contact information to your contact person
4. The following items are needed for the contract only, so you can include them in the draft you send back and do not have to send them separately
